# 🩺 Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements **Binary Classification using Logistic Regression** to predict whether a breast tumor is **Malignant or Benign** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset available in `sklearn`.

The goal of this project is to understand Logistic Regression, feature scaling, evaluation metrics, ROC curve, sigmoid function, and threshold tuning.

This project is completed as part of **AI & ML Internship – Task 4 (Classification with Logistic Regression).**
